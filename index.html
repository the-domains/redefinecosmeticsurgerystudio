<p>The benefits of removing excess fat can be enormous, literally and figuratively, and liposuction is among the cosmetic surgery procedures with the highest rate of patient satisfaction. Many patients experience an immediate improvement in their self-esteem and overall confidence. Liposuction may be performed alone or with plastic surgery procedures such as a face and neck lift, breast reduction or tummy tuck. The procedure was first performed in 1974 and there have been many advances in techniques over the enduing 38 years, making it one of the most predictable and popular body-contouring surgeries in the world. Who is a suitable candidate: The ideal liposuction candidate is at, or near their ideal weight, with good skin elasticity and is seeking reduction of diet- and exercise-resistant localised pockets of fat. Common sites include the upper arms, hips, outer thighs, abdomen, mid back, buttocks, knees, neck and chin. Some men have excess fatty tissue in and around the breast, or gynaecomastia, which can also be removed. Liposuction is not a way of losing weight. If you have excess loose skin, liposuction can actually make it worse. If this is the case, a surgical body lift procedure may be required instead. Your surgeon will advise the best options. It should also be noted that liposuction does not improve cellulite (the dimpled appearance of the skin of commonly seen on the buttocks and thighs) or stretch marks (caused by pregnancy or rapid weight gain). What it involves: Liposuction surgically removes deposits of subcutaneous fat from specific areas of the body such as the thighs, hips, abdomen, buttocks, knees, upper arms, neck and chin. While the terms are often used interchangeably, liposculpture implies more subtle shaping and contouring. There are generally three ways to remove the fat: the traditional cannula method, the syringe technique and the energy-assisted method, which can further be broken into numerous sub-categories . The basic procedure involves the insertion of a small tube-like instrument, called a cannula, into the layer of subcutaneous fat via tiny incisions made by the surgeon. The cannula is connected to a clear plastic hose that leads to a suction source. The surgeon moves in a specific pattern through the fat layer to break up fat cells, which are then vacuumed or suctioned out. The overlying skin remains attached to the connective tissue and underlying muscles of the skin during the operation. A thin blanket of fat is left under the skin to help prevent rippling or bumpy skin occurring afterwards. There are two main layers of subcutaneous fat: superficial and deep. Liposuction is primarily focused on the deeper layer of fat, since suctioning is thought to be safer and easier there. Suctioning in the superficial layer allows the surgeon to achieve subtle benefits in the procedure but, because of its proximity to blood vessels and nerve endings, it can increase the risk of contour irregularities and injury to the skin. Some surgeons believe superficial liposuction enhances skin retraction. Although the cannula is designed to slide through fat tissue and cause minimum damage to blood vessels and nerves, some may be injured during the procedure. If only a small amount of fat and a limited number of body sites are involved, liposuction can be performed under local anaesthetic, usually in conjunction with intravenous sedation. If a large volume of fat is being removed, some patients prefer general anaesthetic. In addition to fat, body fluid is also removed during the procedure. Because of this, patients are given fluids intravenously during the operation. The aim of liposuction is to decrease the bulk of fat in a specific area, but not to remove all fat. Removing too much can cause loose skin and surface irregularities. Depending on the size and number of the areas being treated, as well as the technique employed by the surgeon, the procedure can last from around 1-5 hours. Risks: Asymmetry, rippling or bagginess of skin, pigmentation changes, skin injury, fluid retention, excessive fluid loss leading to shock, infection. Downtime and recovery: The inscision sites are generally closed loosely so that the excess fluid drains out. This happens in the first 24 to 48 hrs . You can expect to be swollen and bruised and most patients report feeling sore for a few days. It is also common to experience some numbness in the treated areas, although this should go away in the first few weeks. You are required to wear a compression garment for up to 12 weeks. You can return to work in 1-2 weeks and more strenuous activity in 2- 4 weeks. When you will see results: Full recovery from swelling and bruising may take 1-5 months or more. Improvements will be evident as soon as swelling subsides, but it can take from 6-12 months to achieve the final effect. How long it lasts: Results are permanent, with sensible diet and exercise.</p><p> Liposuction The benefits of removing excess fat can be enormous, literally and figuratively, and liposuction is among the cosmetic surgery procedures with the highest rate of patient satisfaction.

High Definition Liposculpting Indication for Liposuction: Liposuction sculpts or contours the body; it must be stressed that the aim is to alter the patient's shape rather than their overall weight. It is certainly effective in the removal of unwanted bulges and in improving the silhouette, but it is not a method for the treatment of general obesity. Fat cells removed by liposuction are permanently removed. Fat can never regenerate in the specific area thus treated. However, by eating excessively one may still gain extra weight and fatty bulges in other areas. To be specific, areas of the body that can be helped by liposuction are: the hips, inner thighs, outer thighs ('saddle-bags' or 'riding-breeches'), the abdomen or stomach, the buttocks, the waist (‘love-handles’, problematic for men) upper arms, knees, ankles, the over-developed male breast, the ‘dowagers hump’ problem, and the double chin. Liposuction may be carried out in a number of areas at the same time or can be combined with another procedure. For example, it may be done with a facelift where excess fat is present under the chin. The amount of fat removed is up to the surgeon.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="15"><!-- react-empty: 16 --></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="17"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><!-- react-empty: 21 --><!-- react-empty: 22 --><!-- react-empty: 23 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="24"><p data-reactid="25"> Breast </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="26"><p data-reactid="27">Breasts under go a lot of changes in time.

Many patients experience an immediate improvement in their self-esteem and overall confidence. Liposuction may be performed alone or with plastic surgery procedures such as a face and neck lift, breast reduction or tummy tuck. The procedure was first performed in 1974 and there have been many advances in techniques over the enduing 38 years, making it one of the most predictable and popular body-contouring surgeries in the world. Who is a suitable candidate: The ideal liposuction candidate is at, or near their ideal weight, with good skin elasticity and is seeking reduction of diet- and exercise-resistant localised pockets of fat. Common sites include the upper arms, hips, outer thighs, abdomen, mid back, buttocks, knees, neck and chin. Some men have excess fatty tissue in and around the breast, or gynaecomastia, which can also be removed. Liposuction is not a way of losing weight. If you have excess loose skin, liposuction can actually make it worse. If this is the case, a surgical body lift procedure may be required instead. Your surgeon will advise the best options. It should also be noted that liposuction does not improve cellulite (the dimpled appearance of the skin of commonly seen on the buttocks and thighs) or stretch marks (caused by pregnancy or rapid weight gain). What it involves: Liposuction surgically removes deposits of subcutaneous fat from specific areas of the body such as the thighs, hips, abdomen, buttocks, knees, upper arms, neck and chin. While the terms are often used interchangeably, liposculpture implies more subtle shaping and contouring. There are generally three ways to remove the fat: the traditional cannula method, the syringe technique and the energy-assisted method, which can further be broken into numerous sub-categories . The basic procedure involves the insertion of a small tube-like instrument, called a cannula, into the layer of subcutaneous fat via tiny incisions made by the surgeon. The cannula is connected to a clear plastic hose that leads to a suction source. The surgeon moves in a specific pattern through the fat layer to break up fat cells, which are then vacuumed or suctioned out. The overlying skin remains attached to the connective tissue and underlying muscles of the skin during the operation. A thin blanket of fat is left under the skin to help prevent rippling or bumpy skin occurring afterwards. There are two main layers of subcutaneous fat: superficial and deep. Liposuction is primarily focused on the deeper layer of fat, since suctioning is thought to be safer and easier there. Suctioning in the superficial layer allows the surgeon to achieve subtle benefits in the procedure but, because of its proximity to blood vessels and nerve endings, it can increase the risk of contour irregularities and injury to the skin. Some surgeons believe superficial liposuction enhances skin retraction. Although the cannula is designed to slide through fat tissue and cause minimum damage to blood vessels and nerves, some may be injured during the procedure. If only a small amount of fat and a limited number of body sites are involved, liposuction can be performed under local anaesthetic, usually in conjunction with intravenous sedation. If a large volume of fat is being removed, some patients prefer general anaesthetic. In addition to fat, body fluid is also removed during the procedure. Because of this, patients are given fluids intravenously during the operation. The aim of liposuction is to decrease the bulk of fat in a specific area, but not to remove all fat. Removing too much can cause loose skin and surface irregularities. Depending on the size and number of the areas being treated, as well as the technique employed by the surgeon, the procedure can last from around 1-5 hours. Risks: Asymmetry, rippling or bagginess of skin, pigmentation changes, skin injury, fluid retention, excessive fluid loss leading to shock, infection. Downtime and recovery: The inscision sites are generally closed loosely so that the excess fluid drains out. This happens in the first 24 to 48 hrs . You can expect to be swollen and bruised and most patients report feeling sore for a few days. It is also common to experience some numbness in the treated areas, although this should go away in the first few weeks. You are required to wear a compression garment for up to 12 weeks. You can return to work in 1-2 weeks and more strenuous activity in 2- 4 weeks. When you will see results: Full recovery from swelling and bruising may take 1-5 months or more.
