<p>Other than surgical correction - using Breast implants or the person's own body fat - there is no method that can increase the size and fullness of the breasts. Unfortunately, no amount of exercise, hormonal treatment or creams can have any noticeable effect on the dimensions of small breasts. This is why breast augmentation(breast implants) has become a very popular method of enhancing the female form. Breast augmentation(breast implants) has been successful world-wide and has helped many women attain a better figure, which in turn has made an important psychological contribution to their feelings of femininity, confidence, well-being and happiness. Physical and psychological factors are closely linked here; thus, patients are carefully assessed and guided in realising their expectations.</p><picture>

<p> Breast Breasts under go a lot of changes in time. Pregnancy and lactation often changes the shape of the breasts making it more loose or saggy. Deflated or droopy shapeless breasts is a confidence breaker. There are a wide range of definative surgical options from implants to lifts to regain your lost confidence. Breast Implants Breast augmentation(breast implants) is suitable for women who perceive their breasts as being too small, either because they have never had full development of breast tissue or as a result of the loss of breast tissue that sometimes occurs after pregnancy and breast-feeding. Small breasts may also be due to massive weight loss. If breast sagging accompanies small breast volume, a breast uplift operation, Mastopexy, may be required.The enlargement can be done by either using an breast implant (silicone/saline) or by Natural breast augmentation using fat. The breast augmentation(breast implant) surgery does not usually alter breast function. Since the operation does not interfere with breast tissue, the possibility of breast-feeding after pregnancy remains unaltered. It must be remembered that not all women can breast-feed successfully anyway - the important point here being that the breast will function the same after treatment as before. There may be altered nipple sensation. Additionally, breast implats does not increase or decrease the chances of developing breast cancer. Hundreds of thousands of augmentation mammoplasties(breast implants) have been performed worldwide and there has never been any demonstrated relationship between breast implants and breast cancer or any other breast disease. Breast implant surgery usually is done on a day care basis. You can go home the same day after the breast implant surgery.Breast Implant Surgery is a day care procedure generally taking 45 mins to an hour unless it is combined with any other procedure like a lift. Swelling will be for a few weeks during which a snugly fitting sports bra is encouraged. Massaging can be started within 3 weeks while taking a shower. Sexual acitivity can be resumed with in a month.</p><p>Breast Reduction and lift</p><picture>

Sexual acitivity can be resumed with in a month. Breast Reduction and lift Ever felt that your breasts were too large and heavy -- hanging uncomfortably low? Then, you are the right candidate for a breast reduction surgery (Reduction Mammoplasty). Breast reduction surgery removes some of the tissue and skin from the breasts to reshape and reduce the size of the breasts. It can also make the area of dark skin surrounding the nipple (areola) smaller. To remove tissue and skin from the breast, the surgeon first makes one or more cuts in the breast. After the excess tissue and skin have been removed, the skin is closed with stitches. Sometimes the nipple and areola have to be removed and repositioned. Breast reduction surgery is done in a hospital or surgical center usually using general anesthesia. The surgery usually takes 3 to 5 hours. An overnight stay is not usually required. For smaller reductions, the surgery may be done with local anesthesia. A breast lift (Mastopexy) is similar to a breast reduction, except that in most cases only skin is removed for a breast lift. A breast lift can raise sagging or drooping breasts, which is a common problem with large, heavy breasts, and can elevate the nipple and areola. To lift the breasts, excess skin from the bottom of the breast and the area around the areola is removed. The remaining skin is then brought together, which tightens and raises the breast.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

Breast Breasts under go a lot of changes in time. Pregnancy and lactation often changes the shape of the breasts making it more loose or saggy. Deflated or droopy shapeless breasts is a confidence breaker. There are a wide range of definative surgical options from implants to lifts to regain your lost confidence. Breast Implants Breast augmentation(breast implants) is suitable for women who perceive their breasts as being too small, either because they have never had full development of breast tissue or as a result of the loss of breast tissue that sometimes occurs after pregnancy and breast-feeding. Small breasts may also be due to massive weight loss. If breast sagging accompanies small breast volume, a breast uplift operation, Mastopexy, may be required.The enlargement can be done by either using an breast implant (silicone/saline) or by Natural breast augmentation using fat. The breast augmentation(breast implant) surgery does not usually alter breast function. Since the operation does not interfere with breast tissue, the possibility of breast-feeding after pregnancy remains unaltered. It must be remembered that not all women can breast-feed successfully anyway - the important point here being that the breast will function the same after treatment as before. There may be altered nipple sensation. Additionally, breast implats does not increase or decrease the chances of developing breast cancer. Hundreds of thousands of augmentation mammoplasties(breast implants) have been performed worldwide and there has never been any demonstrated relationship between breast implants and breast cancer or any other breast disease. Breast implant surgery usually is done on a day care basis. You can go home the same day after the breast implant surgery. Other than surgical correction - using Breast implants or the person's own body fat - there is no method that can increase the size and fullness of the breasts. Unfortunately, no amount of exercise, hormonal treatment or creams can have any noticeable effect on the dimensions of small breasts. This is why breast augmentation(breast implants) has become a very popular method of enhancing the female form. Breast augmentation(breast implants) has been successful world-wide and has helped many women attain a better figure, which in turn has made an important psychological contribution to their feelings of femininity, confidence, well-being and happiness. Physical and psychological factors are closely linked here; thus, patients are carefully assessed and guided in realising their expectations. Breast Implant Surgery is a day care procedure generally taking 45 mins to an hour unless it is combined with any other procedure like a lift. Swelling will be for a few weeks during which a snugly fitting sports bra is encouraged. Massaging can be started within 3 weeks while taking a shower. Sexual acitivity can be resumed with in a month. Breast Reduction and lift Ever felt that your breasts were too large and heavy -- hanging uncomfortably low? Then, you are the right candidate for a breast reduction surgery (Reduction Mammoplasty). Breast reduction surgery removes some of the tissue and skin from the breasts to reshape and reduce the size of the breasts. It can also make the area of dark skin surrounding the nipple (areola) smaller. To remove tissue and skin from the breast, the surgeon first makes one or more cuts in the breast. After the excess tissue and skin have been removed, the skin is closed with stitches. Sometimes the nipple and areola have to be removed and repositioned. Breast reduction surgery is done in a hospital or surgical center usually using general anesthesia. The surgery usually takes 3 to 5 hours. An overnight stay is not usually required. For smaller reductions, the surgery may be done with local anesthesia. A breast lift (Mastopexy) is similar to a breast reduction, except that in most cases only skin is removed for a breast lift. A breast lift can raise sagging or drooping breasts, which is a common problem with large, heavy breasts, and can elevate the nipple and areola. To lift the breasts, excess skin from the bottom of the breast and the area around the areola is removed. The remaining skin is then brought together, which tightens and raises the breast.","_html":"<p> Breast Breasts under go a lot of changes in time.
